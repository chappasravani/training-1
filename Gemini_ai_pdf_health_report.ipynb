            "\n",
            "**1. WIDAL Test (for Typhoid Fever):** This test checks for antibodies against *Salmonella Typhi* and *Salmonella Paratyphi*, bacteria that cause typhoid fever.  The numbers (e.g., 1:160, 1:80, 1:20) represent the dilution of the blood sample at which antibodies are still detectable.  Higher numbers suggest a greater likelihood of infection. In this case:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **S. Typhi \"O\" 1:160:** Suggests a possible past or present infection with *Salmonella Typhi*.\n",
            "* **S. Typhi \"H\" 1:80:** Similar to above, but a slightly lower level.\n",
            "* **S. Paratyphi \"AH\" 1:20:**  Within the normal range, suggesting no current infection with this bacteria.\n",
            "* **S. Paratyphi \"BH\" 1:20:**  Within the normal range, suggesting no current infection with this bacteria.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Dengue Serology:** This test checks for dengue fever, a viral infection spread by mosquitoes.  The results are all negative, meaning no current dengue infection is detected.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Dengue NS1 Antigen:** A protein found in the blood during the acute phase of dengue.\n",
            "* **Dengue IgG:** Antibodies that appear later in the infection and indicate past exposure.\n",
            "* **Dengue IgM:** Antibodies that appear early in the infection.\n",
            "\n",
            "**3. Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR):**  This measures how quickly red blood cells settle at the bottom of a test tube.  A higher ESR can indicate inflammation in the body. Mr. Goud's ESR is elevated (26 mm/hr in the first hour, 52 mm/hr in the second), suggesting possible inflammation.\n",
            "\n",
            "**4. Rapid Malaria Test:** This test checks for the presence of malaria parasites in the blood.  Both tests (for *Plasmodium falciparum* (P.F) and *Plasmodium vivax* (P.V)) are negative, meaning no malaria infection is detected.\n",
            "\n",

            "* **White Blood Cells (WBC):** Cells that fight infection.  His count is within the normal range.\n",
            "* **Platelet Count:** Cells that help blood clot.  His count is within the normal range.\n",
            "* **Packed Cell Volume (PCV):** The percentage of red blood cells in the blood. His level is within the normal range.\n",
            "* **Differential Count:** This breaks down the types of white blood cells.  All are within normal ranges.\n",
            "* **Peripheral Blood Smear:** A microscopic examination of the blood.  The report indicates that all components are within the normal limits\n",
            "\n",
            "**6. HbA1c:** This test measures average blood sugar levels over the past 2-3 months.  Mr. Goud's level is within the normal non-diabetic range, indicating good blood sugar control.\n",
            "\n",
            "**7. Serum Creatinine:** This test measures the level of creatinine in the blood, a waste product from muscle metabolism. It's an indicator of kidney function. Mr. Goud's level is within the normal range.\n",
            "\n",
            "**8. Random Blood Glucose:** This measures blood sugar level at a random time.  Mr. Goud's level is within the normal range.\n",
            "\n",
            "**9. Liver Function Test (LFT):**  These tests assess the health of the liver.  All results are within normal limits.  The tests include:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Serum Bilirubin (Total, Direct, Indirect):** Bilirubin is a byproduct of the breakdown of red blood cells.  Elevated levels can indicate liver problems.\n",
            "* **Serum Alkaline Phosphatase:** An enzyme found in the liver and bones.\n",
            "* **SGOT (AST) and SGPT (ALT):** Liver enzymes; elevated levels indicate liver damage.\n",
            "* **Total Protein and Albumin:** Proteins in the blood; levels help assess liver function.\n",
            "* **Globulin:**  Another protein in the blood.\n",
            "* **A/G Ratio:** The ratio of albumin to globulin.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "* **Serum Sodium:** Important for fluid balance. Mr. Goud's level is slightly low (hyponatremia).\n",
            "* **Serum Potassium:** Important for muscle function and heart rhythm. His level is within the normal range.\n",

Mr. Goud should discuss these results with his doctor, Dr. Krishna Prasad, to understand their implications for his health and receive appropriate medical care.
